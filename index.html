                                <p>Call me Akshay. I like machines and enjoy how brains computing come together. </p>

                                <p>Iâ€™m a Masters student in Information Technology and Management at the Illinois Institute of Technology creating various projects at the intersection of mobile application development and artificial intelligence. At the College of Computing for Information Technology, I use reactive methods to analyze patterns of brain actuation to create and use tools that can characterize artificial intelligence projects.</p>

                                <p>My research is based on the free energy principle, which unifies everything under the concept of "minimizing free energy," including artificial intelligence, economics, and stochastic modeling. The conjectural system actively changes the environment into the desired state by using the stochastic notion of the brain as a "inference engine," which minimizes the system's free energy. In this approach, we may improve machines by applying the same psychological principles that govern humans and vice versa. My personal initiative is what motivates me to do my work.</p>

                                <h2>About Me</h2>

                                <p>The son of a plumber and daycare worker, I began my journey on the coattails of kids in New Delhi, India to America in search of opportunity. As a child, I grew fond of technology, finding it as an expressive way to understand the world. Soon, I fell in love with coding for its expressive power in conveying the "pragmatic aspect" of ideas. Inspired by writers like John Horgan and Stephen R. Covey, I wanted to dive deep into initiating my own work, writing, and anything I could get my mind on.</p>

                                <p>I created projects spanning computational biology and artificial intelligence while studying physics and computing at the university, which were intertwined like a MÃ¶bius strip. I worked at HYPD after I received my degree, creating, building, and scaling their mobile application for iOS and partially for Android, managing more than a million users, before enrolling in the M.A.S. in Information Technology and Management at the Illinois Institute of Technology. It doesn't matter if I'm discussing research ethics or figuring out a math problem, I continue to chase the interest sparked by thinking about the sterile and unpredictable algorithms that science has to offer. I now want to share my never-ending yearning for computing with everyone.</p>

                                <p>In my free time, I enjoy playing cricket, writing, reading, and cycling. Views are mine. This site may use cookies.</p>
